    <h2>The Fiji Layover</h2>

    <p>My Australia trip started out with a 3 day layover in Fiji in December of 2016 with my then girlfriend Maddison. When I boarded the plane it was a cold and dreary day. Arriving in Fiji it was sunny with a high of 80<span>&#8457;</span>. It was hard to believe that other places of the world were experiencing summer as Missouri was making it's way into winter. A day trip to the island on the right brought a rainy day but despite that one lots of fun was had with snorkeling and open buffet.</p>

    <h2>Christmas In Summer</h2>

    <p>When I traditionally think of Christmas I think of possible snow with baked ham on the dinner table. In Australia we camped in Melbourne in Maddison's aunt's backyard. There we had what seemed more of a 4th of July barbecue with a smoked ham, prawns, and oysters. I got to meet and wrestle all her male cousins and have a water balloon fight. To top it off we opened presents and Christmas crackers. I was excited to win a yellow party hat on the left.</p>

    <p>My favorite part of Australia besides the people that I met was definitely the miles of white sand beaches. To me they are comparable to Missouri's Ozark streams in the level of peace and tranquility that is felt. Time so seemingly dissolves and a simpleness of life manifests along with an enduring feeling of never wanting to leave. One day I will return.</p>

    <h2>Sydney</h2>

    <p>Sydney was a great city with a lot to offer including a vibrant downtown in which we stayed. There we went to the normal tourist attractions including the Sydney Harbor Bridge and the iconic Sydney Opera House.</p>

    <h2>Chinese New Year</h2>
    <img src="Pics\NewYear\DSC_0038.jpg" alt="A Sydney Chinese New Year Festival scene.">
    <img src="Pics\NewYear\DSC_0219.jpg" alt="Blow up panda bears.">
    <p>Chinese New Year is based on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar and celebrated between the 21st of January and the 20th of February. Sydney is home to a large asian population being so relatively close in proximity. Decorative lights were abundant as well as song, dance, and food. I particularly enjoyed listening to the music of the traditional Chinese instruments.</p>

    <img src="Pics\Food\IMG_3815.jpg" alt="Two men eating fish and chips.">
    <p>If the proverbial saying "You are what you eat" holds true then I had assimilated myself as an Australian within hours of landing. Seen on the right is the newly met father-in-law who came to pick us up and fed us fish and chips, the locals favorite choice for lunch. I soon found out the onion rings were not in fact onion rings but fried squid called Calamari. Mornay oysters ready to be grilled are seen on the left.</p>

    <h2>Wildlife</h2>

    <p>When most people think of the wildlife in Australia they think of Steve Irwin jumping on a crocodile or lists of "Top 10 creatures that can kill you." The truth is that a lot of those areas exist, but the continent and wildlife is a lot more diverse than the outback or the more tropical regions of Queensland. There can also be rolling plains areas of yellow, green pasture for farming, and temperate forests. We stayed in the latter in New South Wales. On the left is the colorful Lorikeet and on the right the stereotypical Kangaroo.</p>
